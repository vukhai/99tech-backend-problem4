# 99Tech Backend Problem 4

A TypeScript implementation of three different approaches to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers.

## Quick Start

    git clone https://github.com/vukhai/99tech-backend-problem4.git

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the code:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What it does

The code implements three different algorithms to calculate sum from 1 to n:

- **Mathematical formula** (O(1) time)
- **Iterative approach** (O(n) time)
- **Recursive approach** (O(n) time, O(n) space)

## Requirements

- Node.js
- TypeScript (included in devDependencies)
